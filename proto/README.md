So... I actually don't know rust, at all. This is what I'm using to try and learn it before I actually do anything worthwhile. 

If you're looking to actually use an MVC framework, this isn't it... YET. This will contain a few rough pieces while learning Rust. 
When I start to feel more comfortable I'll package it into modules and reusable code and drag the code out of this proto directory.
